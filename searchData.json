[{"title":"How to build a blog with hexo","url":"/How-to-build-a-blog-with-hexo/","content":"\nHexo is a blog framework powered by Node.js. I recently built my blog with it and found it extremely easy and fast. The posts are written in Markdown and Hexo will generates static files in seconds. \n\nIn this post I will walk through the steps to setup a blog running locally. There will be another post discussing deploy the blog site to Github page. Here I will only discuss how to install Hexo blog on MacOS. For installation on other platforms such as Windows, please refer to other online posts like [https://www.how2shout.com/how-to/install-hexo-nodejs-blog-on-windows-10-with-github.html](https://www.how2shout.com/how-to/install-hexo-nodejs-blog-on-windows-10-with-github.html)\n\n## Requirems to install Hexo\n* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n* [Git](https://git-scm.com)\n\n## Install Node.js\nRun this script in the terminal:\n``` bash\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | sh\n```\n\nEdit zsh config to load nvm each time:\n\n``` bash\nvi ~/.zshrc\n```\n\nAdd: `[[ -s $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh ]] && . $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh` to the end of the file\n\nThen run the command to install node.js\n``` bash\nnvm install node\n```\n\nAfter the script finishes running, you should see the following output, which means node.js is all set. Great!\n\n{% asset_img node-success.png %}\n\n## Install Git\nNext is install Git so you can checkout code from source repositry. On Mac the easiest way is to use [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh). You can install Brew with one line of command:\n\n``` bash\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n```\n\nAfter Brew is installed, use it to install Git:\n\n``` bash\nBrew install git\n```\n\n## Install Hexo\nWith Node.js and Git all set, you can install Hexo run the following  command\n\n``` bash\nnpm install -g hexo-cli\n```\n\n## Create a blog site\nNow it comes to the moment when you are able to create the blog site. Simply run:\n\n``` bash\nhexo init my-blog\ncd my-blog\nhexo install\n```\n\nHexo will download and create all necessary files to 'my-blog' folder. \n\n## Run the Hexo server\nEverything is ready and you can run the Hexo server to view your blog site!\n\n``` bash\nhexo server\n```\n\nVisit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and you should be able to see the webpage show up\n\n{% asset_img blog-page.png %}\n\n\nCongraturations! You have a blog site up and running. You can create a post using `hexo new post \"Blog title\"`.
